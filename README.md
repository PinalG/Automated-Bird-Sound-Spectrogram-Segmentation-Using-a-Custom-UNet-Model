Bird sound analysis is crucial for monitoring avian biodiversity and conservation. Manual annotation of bird vo-calizations is labor-intensive, prompting the need for automated methods. This paper presents a novel approach to bird sound spectrogram segmentation using a custom UNet-like model. Our dataset includes spectrogram images of bird sounds and corresponding segmentation masks for training, validation, and testing. The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts hierarchical features, and the decoder reconstructs the segmentation mask. We evaluate segmentation accuracy using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, a standard measure for image segmentation. Our results demonstrate the model's efficacy in accurately segmenting bird sound spectrograms, highlighting its potential for automating avian bioacoustic analysis and enhancing biodiversity monitoring efforts.
